**IDENTI-NET** is a character creation game that uses assets from the 1983 Smith & Wesson Identi-Kit Model II. The Identi-Kit was a tool used by police since the '50s to assist witnesses in re-constructing the faces of suspects.

In IDENTI-NET, all the assets from the Identi-Kit have been compiled into one user-friendly package that allows anyone to create a face. Make yourself! Make a friend! Make a monster! The next generation of facial compositing software is in your hands.

## Information
This repository contains the game's source project files, meant for use in [Construct 3](https://construct.net/). The files in this repository are provided as-is.
